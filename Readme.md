# Spring Boot based Java web application
 
This is a simple Sprint Boot based Java application that can be built using Maven. Sprint Boot dependencies are handled using the pom.xml 
at the root directory of the repository.

This is a MVC architecture based application where controller returns a page with title and message attributes to the view.

## Execute the application locally and access it using your browser

Checkout the repo and move to the directory

```
git clone https://github.com/Tushar-ops23/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero.git
cd java-maven-sonar-argocd-helm-k8s/sprint-boot-app
```

Execute the Maven targets to generate the artifacts

```
mvn clean package
```

The above maven target stroes the artifacts to the `target` directory. You can either execute the artifact on your local machine.

### Execute locally (Java 11 needed) and access the application on http://localhost:8080

```
java -jar target/spring-boot-web.jar
```
